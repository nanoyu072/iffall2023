        <p>So won't you? Will you be my cherry?</p>
        <p>So come on talk to me, talk to me</p>
        <p>Will you, will you be mine? </p>
        <p>One, two, three, let's go</p>

        <br>

        <p>Down the subway, you looked my way</p>
        <p>With your girl gaze, with your girl gaze</p>
        <p>That was the day everything changed</p>
        <p>Couldn't stay the same</p>
        <p>Now it's Tuesday and I'm thinking</p>
        <p>'Bout to tuck in, 'bout to tuck in</p>
        <p>Telling myself that it's cheating</p>
        <p>But it's something else</p>

        <br>

        <p>Even though I'm satisfied</p>
        <p>I lead my life within a lie</p>
        <p>Holding onto feelings</p>
        <p>I'm not used to feeling</p>
        <p>'Cause, oh, they make me feel alive</p>

        <br>

        <p>When they tell you that you've got to stay the same</p>
        <p>Even though you're not yourself</p>
        <p>And you've got somebody else</p>
        <p>When they tell you that you've got yourself to blame</p>
        <p>Even though it's not your fault</p>
        <p>But your heart just wants to know, know</p>

        <br>

        <p>Down the subway, you looked my way</p>
        <p>With your girl gaze, with your girl gaze</p>
        <p>That was the day everything changed</p>
        <p>Now it's something else</p>


        <p>Even though I'm satisfied</p>
        <p>I lead my life within a lie</p>
        <p>Holding onto feelings</p>
        <p>I'm not used to feeling</p>
        <p>'Cause, oh, they make me feel alive</p>

        <br>

        <p>So won't you? Will you be my cherry?</p>
        <p>So come on, talk to me, talk to me</p>
        <p>Will you, will you be mine?</p>
        <p>I see you watching me, will you be mine baby?</p>
        <p>Will I be your cherry?</p>
        <p>So come on, talk to me, talk to me</p>
        <p>Will you, will you be mine?</p>
