<h1>Intro Questions</h1>
<ol>
    <li>Name: Lynn Yuan</li>
    <li>Junior in BFA Communications Design</li>
    <li>I am from Guiyang, China and I am interested in front end website design.</li>
    <li>I've done some basic HTML and CSS before in online courses</li>
    <li>I hope to learn how to easily navigate HTML language through this course</li>
    <li>When designing for a screen, I need to be aware of the size of the device and usability across different devices</li>
    <li>I think the website for the clothing brand Zara shows effective design. through design elements on the webpage, they effectively communicate their brand. https://www.zara.com/us/</li>
    <li>It may be a rather generic answer, but I think that google has very effective communication. While it may not be stylistically appealing, it is easy to navigate and find the website you are looking for. https://www.google.com/</li>
    <li>I think that a website that works well is Youtube. They have easy navigation and also a functioning miniplayer and the ability to autoplay vidoeos in a playlist, making it very easy to use. https://www.youtube.com/</li>
